## About Houdini

Developed by **SideFX**, Houdini revolutionized 3D production with its procedural, non-destructive workflow. Instead of manual modeling, every element is created through **interconnected nodes**, allowing total flexibility and infinite variations.  

Artists can simulate **fire, smoke, water, sand, and destruction** with physically accurate solvers. Every project remains editable at any stage — change one parameter, and the entire scene adapts automatically.  

Its rendering capabilities, including **Karma XPU and Mantra**, provide high-end visualization from concept to final frame. Used in blockbuster movies and AAA games, Houdini’s scalability and precision make it a top choice for VFX professionals.
